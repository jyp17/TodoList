TODO LIST

This is a todo list application. It will record all the tasks you add into a readable list.

To add a task: type the task into the text field then click the "Add" button. You cannot add a blank task (i.e. nothing typed into the text field or only a white-space entry).

To clear tasks: click the "Clear All" button to remove all the tasks you've added.
